# REST-API
Simple REST API built using with Node.js, Express, &amp; MongoDB

Basically a REST is short for Representational State Transfer which is basically a convention for building HTTP services, by using simple HTTP protocol principles to provide support to Create, Read, Update, Delete data (CRUD).
The idea behind REST is to treat all server URLs as access points for the various resources on the server.

GET Action, used to get a list of all resources, and acts on the entire resource. GET action corresponds to the reading data.

POST Action, used to create new resource , and acts on the entire resource. GET action corresponds to the create data.

Another GET action, used for getting a single user based on the id in the URL.

PUT action, corresponds to update, it updates an existing resource.

DELETE action, deletes the resource with a given ID and acts on a single resource.
